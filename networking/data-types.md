# Data Types

Starbound uses several different data types to move information over the wire. These types are used on the [protocol](/networking) documentation.

* **string**: A length prefixed UTF-8 string, with a VLQ specifying the length.
* **(u)int##**: An integer, in big-endian order. "u" indicates unsiged and ## is the length, in bits. Examples: uint8, int32, etc.
* **(s)VLQ**: [Variable length quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_quantity). "s" indicates signed. See below.
* **(u)int##[]**: An integer array. Arrays without a fixed length are prefixed with a VLQ indicating their length. Examples: uint8[], int32[10]
* **bool**: A boolean value (true or false). Encoded as a uint8, 0 indicates false and 1 indicates true.
* **float**: 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point number.
* **double**: 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point number.
* **Variant**: Data serialization format. See below.


## VLQ

Variable length quantities (VLQs) are widely used throughout starbound. An example by conversion follows:
To convert 601000 to an unsigned VLQ, starting in little-endian, we end up with a binary representation of 601000 as `10010010101110101000`.

The next step is to split the binary into groups of 7, starting from the LSB. This gives us `100100 1010111 0101000`. We then pad all but the LSB segment with 1, to signify it's a continuation bit. On the MSB, we pad as necessary with 0s to achieve a full octet.

The result from this operation is `10100100 11010111 00101000`, which is the unsigned VLQ. The conversion backwards is much the same.

A signed VLQ is very similar, but with a simple flag to demonstrate parity. For -601000, we simply pad the end with an extra bit. From `10010010101110101000` we pad a 1 for the negative, giving us `100100101011101010001`, broken into 7-bit groups, `1001001 0101110 1010001`. Finally, with continuation bits, `11001001 10101110 11010001`.

## Variant

The Variant type is a relatively complex structure that incorporates many other types into its construction.

The first byte of a variant indicates its type. Depending on that byte, one of 8 different formats may follow.

### Type 1
`null`

### Type 2
A `double`

### Type 3
A `bool`

### Type 4
A `VLQ`

### Type 5
A `string`

### Type 6
A `VLQ` indicating the number of items, and then followed by that number of `Variant`s.

### Type 7
A `VLQ` indicating the number of items, and then a sequence of key-value pairs made up of a `string` and a `Variant`.
